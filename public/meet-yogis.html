                    destined to be sold. </p>
                <p class="py-3">A Metta Yogi, however, stands for his owner. Every significant trait symbolizes a potential or a quality that can be developed.</p>
                <p class="py-3">Every one of the traits were meticulously hand drawn. All possible combinations of the traits could produce several million unique NFTs, however only 888 will be minted from traits combined by an algorithm.</p>

                <h2>How to play</h2>
                <p>To play the game you will first need to get an NFT Metta Yogi. On launch 888 yogis will be minted giving players a chance to get started from the early. </p>
                <p>The cost of a Metta Yogi NFT will be kept at a low price making it easy and inexpensive to play the game, normally within the reasonable range of 20-80 USD. </p>
                <p>If one misses out on the mint, new and more special characters will be auctioned off at various times, post mint.</p>
                <p> The MettaYogi NFT will have a random set of attributes and characteristics that will factor into game play later.</p>
